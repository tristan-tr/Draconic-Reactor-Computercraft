# Draconic-Reactor-Computercraft
Automates the Draconic Reactor from Draconic Evolution for 1.12.2

# Setup
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rBhQP1xqEU) from The MindCrafters explains it. This is using a different script, however the setup is the same.

You can also use an emergency charge system, if you do want that then you'll need to put a flux gate inputting energy into an energy injector above the computer.

# Installation
Paste these lines into the computer

`pastebin get GBMUNXdR startup`

`startup`
